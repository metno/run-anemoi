* Lightning setup
** Creating datsets
We have created a lightning dataset from the last 3 seasons, which
include the variables thunder_count (number of lightning strikes
during the last 6h), thunder_count_25km (sum of thunder_count inside a
25km box), and thunder_event (equal to 1 if thunder_count_25km >=
20). In total we have 3 datasets, that we combine in the training
process with anemoi-datasets:
*** breeze_force_o96_6h.zarr
This dataset includes the variables 
**** cos_julian_day
**** cos_latitude 
**** cos_local_time
**** cos_longitude
**** insolation
**** latitude
**** longitude
**** sin_julian_day
**** sin_latitude
**** sin_local_time
**** sin_longitude
**** thunder_count
**** thunder_count_25km
**** thunder_event
*** lightning_z.zarr
*** lightning_mask.zarr
